# Twitter-Analysis-using-R

The dataset provides the twitter data of Elon Musk from2010-2021. For analysis consider
the years 2017-2021. Each year has thousands of tweets. Assume each year to be a
document (all the tweets in one year will be considered as a document).


1. Compute word frequencies for each year. Exclude the stop words
2. Show top 10 words (for each year) by the highest value of word frequency
3. Plot histogram of word frequencies for each year
4. Use Zipfâ€™s law and plot log-log plots of word frequencies and rank for each year
5. Create bigram network graphs for each year
